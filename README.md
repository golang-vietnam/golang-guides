# Golang Guides

Welcome to the open-source Golang Guides. Our goal is to become the **central crowdsourced resource** for complete and up-to-date Golang content and tutorials. [Just take me to the notes](https://github.com/golang-vietnam/golang-guides/wiki)!

We have guides for everyone whether you are **beginner, intermediate or advanced**. We got you covered. We don't waste time with the "theoretical approach" from a book. We cover **exactly the things we use every day** as we are developing apps for contracts.

**Need Help?** Please join the [slack groups](http://golangvietnam.herokuapp.com) for these guides where you can post related questions.

## Motivation

Ever been **frustrated finding information on outdated one-off blog posts and tutorials** that has since become irrelevant? How many times were you googling only to find your answer only on a **2 year old StackOverflow post**? We believe there's got to be a better way. Why not have the community work together to create useful and detailed documentation for every aspect of Go (or any platform)? There's absolutely no reason that we should have to make do with outdated, vague or un-editable content anymore.
